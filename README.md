> Professional greenhouse gas emissions calculator designed specifically for organizations in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Calculate your carbon footprint across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions with region-specific emission factors.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Region-Specific Design
- **UAE Grid Factors**: Emirate-specific factors (DEWA, ADWEA, SEWA, FEWA)
- **Saudi Grid Factors**: Region-specific factors including NEOM renewable city
- **GCC Coverage**: Includes Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman
- **Climate Adapted**: Accounts for cooling needs and desalination

### üìä Comprehensive Calculations
- **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from fuel combustion
- **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity
- **Scope 3**: Value chain emissions including:
  - Business travel & employee commuting
  - Water consumption (desalination)
  - Waste disposal
  - Cooling systems

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features
- **Standards Compliant**: GHG Protocol & ISO 14064
- **RESTful API**: Easy integration with existing systems
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection
- **Mobile Responsive**: Calculate on any device
- **Data Privacy**: All calculations performed locally

## üì¶ Installation

### For Web Use
Simply visit the [live calculator](https://edybass.github.io/gcc-emissions-calculator/) - no installation required!

### For Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/edybass/gcc-emissions-calculator.git
cd gcc-emissions-calculator

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Start API server (optional)
python -m src.api.app
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Calculation (Python)

```python
from src.calculator import GHGCalculator

# Initialize calculator
calc = GHGCalculator()

# Calculate Scope 1 emissions
result = calc.calculate_scope1(
    fuel_type="natural_gas",
    amount=10000,
    unit="m3"
)
print(f"Emissions: {result.total} tCO2e")

# Calculate Scope 2 emissions
result = calc.calculate_scope2(
    electricity_kwh=50000,
    location="Dubai",
    method="market_based",
    renewable_percentage=10
)
print(f"Emissions: {result.total} tCO2e")
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Calculate Scope 1 emissions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/calculate/scope1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fuel_type": "diesel",
    "amount": 1000,
    "unit": "L"
  }'

# Get emission factors
curl http://localhost:8000/api/factors
```

### Comprehensive Facility Assessment

```python
# Annual facility assessment
facility_data = {
    "name": "Dubai Manufacturing Plant",
    "fuels": [
        {"type": "natural_gas", "annual_amount": 50000, "unit": "m3"},
        {"type": "diesel", "annual_amount": 10000, "unit": "L"}
    ],
    "electricity": {
        "annual_kwh": 1000000,
        "location": "Dubai",
        "method": "market_based",
        "renewable_percentage": 15
    },
    "transport": [
        {"mode": "car_medium", "annual_distance": 50000},
        {"mode": "airplane_gcc", "annual_distance": 20000}
    ],
    "water": {
        "annual_m3": 5000,
        "type": "desalinated_water_uae"
    }
}

results = calculate_annual_emissions(calc, facility_data)
print(f"Total Annual Emissions: {results['total']} tCO2e")
```

## üìä Emission Factors

### Electricity Grid Factors (kg CO2e/kWh)

| Location | Factor | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| UAE (National) | 0.450 | IEA 2023 |
| Dubai (DEWA) | 0.440 | DEWA Sustainability Report |
| Abu Dhabi (ADWEA) | 0.460 | ADWEA 2023 |
| Saudi Arabia | 0.720 | SEC 2023 |
